          received from the student, including advance payments, tuition fees, admission charges, or any

          days of each month. If payment is made between the 8th and 10th of the month, a fine of 20 Rs
          per student will be levied. After the 10th, the fine will increase by an additional 50 Rs per student
          every 5 days, regardless of whether the student has paid or not. Teachers must keep accurate
          records of their earnings from the students provided by &#34;<span className="text-indigo-500 font-bold">My Classes Tripura</span>&#34; and provide

          attempting to persuade students to take classes outside of the platform, soliciting students for
          personal classes or private tutoring without the platformaposs knowledge, or engaging in any
          behavior that undermines the platform&#39;s business model. Any teacher found engaging in such
          practices will have their account terminated immediately, and legal action may be taken. &#34;My
