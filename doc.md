i was a fine developer
i had avoided web development as the wid west style craziness of the web dev libraries and kibraries and cross compatibility betwee them all intimidated me a little, i understood web dev was about finding libraries and frameworks that are compatible with one another, a signle library with the wrong version could leed you to version correction dead lock where you infinitly correct the versions of modules untill you decide to write from scrath

deu to my friend's request i picked up web dev again going back to the horror days of using react for the first time 2 years ago, luckily i did well enough this time and found it slightly easier , but then i came across "next-auth" next auth was a library that war recomeneded to me by a website to easily handle authentication but little did i know how i would regret this decision, while next auth does in some words make it easier easier to add authentication, it adds such a layer of abstraction even simple consepts about jwt and sessions seem in mystery, and the minimal amount of control i had while using next-auth with type script i just kept making interfaces upon interfaces uppon interfaces 

i have decided throw away this shrade of abstraction and make my own auth logic, it can be tough and i probably dont know all the things i will need to implement, but i need answers, answer to WHY DOESN'T NEXT AUTH AUTOMATICALLY SET THE SESSION DATA VALUES BASED ON THE USER PASSED TO IN IN THE CREDENTIALS PROVIDER 

will purge next-auth
